## What it does

- Saves all open File Explorer tabs to disk every few seconds
- Detects when Explorer is reopened and restores all tabs automatically
- Sits in the system tray — right-click to save, restore, or open settings
- Double-click the tray icon to open Settings

---

## Requirements

- Windows 11 22H2 or later (Build 22621+) — tabs are a Windows 11 feature
- [.NET 8 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (Desktop Runtime)

## Build from source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Umair-Fareed/Explorer-Tabs-Manager.git
cd Explorer-Tabs-Manager

# 2. Restore & build
dotnet build ExplorerTabManager/ExplorerTabManager.csproj -c Release

# 3. Run
dotnet run --project ExplorerTabManager/ExplorerTabManager.csproj
```

Or open `ExplorerTabManager.sln` in **Visual Studio 2022** and press `F5`.

The app starts in the system tray. No window appears on launch — look for the icon in the notification area.

## Want the one-click installer instead?

No .NET knowledge required. The installer sets everything up automatically, including autostart on Windows login.
